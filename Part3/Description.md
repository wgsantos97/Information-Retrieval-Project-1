## Notes

> It appears that the fewer/less specific the terms are, the poorer the quality of the search is. However, keywords seem to also be related to the quality of the search because once "comic" was added to the last query, the precision dramatically improved.

> Rocchio's algorithm seems to have a direct correlation with how specific the query is as well. Given the user feedback, it generally responded consistently. However, there was one peculiar observation made. Sherlock Holmes appeared number one in most of the queries despite being marked as irrelevant in the user feedback prompt.
